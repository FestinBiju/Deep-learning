# PROJECT 1 :Handwritten Digit Recognition with MNIST
This project uses the popular MNIST dataset of handwritten numbers to create a model that can recognize digits from 0 to 9. The process includes exploring the data, cleaning it, and preparing it for training a machine learning model to accurately recognize these handwritten digits.

# PROJECT 2: Brain tumor classification using CNN
This project focuses on classifying brain MRI images to detect the presence of a brain tumor. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between images labeled as "Tumor" or "No Tumor."
